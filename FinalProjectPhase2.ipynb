    "This dataset was accessed from UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, where it was created by Elaine Fehrman, Vincent Egan, and Evgeny Mirkes. This data set was created to evaluate an individual's risk of drug consumption and misuse based on categorical data. This data collection was independantly created by the authors of the data set. An anonymous online survey methodology from Survey Gizmo was used to collect this data, which could have influenced people's responses because they can choose which questions to answer honestly or not. The people had to take a personality test to get the personality data. The data was analyzed and organized by the three authors listed at the beginning of this paragraph, and the uci machine learning repositiory obtained it for us to get the current form of the data. The people responding were aware of the data collection, as they filled out the form voluntarily, and knew what the data was going to be used for."

In this article about the data: https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06297, the biases described were as follows: the sample was highly educated and all native english speaking. The largest bias of the data was that its respondants were 91.2% white. This could affect how representative the data is of the general population, especially any racial category besides white, as well as less educated and non-native speakers. Also, the data for the targets about the drug use was seperated into classes that described the last time the respondants had used the drug. This was difficult to quanitify and represent as numbers, and we may have not chosen the most accurate way to represent the drug use of the responders. "
