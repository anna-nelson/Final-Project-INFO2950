    "#### Background Information\n",
    "Drugs heavily impact the personality traits and characteristics of an individual, especially based on the frequency of their useage and of what drug. In this project, we aim to explore whether we can predict a person's drug use based on their personality traits. To do so, we would explore potentional correlations between specific personality traits and drug use,looking at: neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, conscientiousness, impulsivity, and sensation seeking. We will train a multivariable regression to see if we can reliably predict a person's drug use based on a person's personality traits. It is important to recognize hightened or unusual personality traits, especially in individuals who could be exposed to life-threatening drugs or unsafe situations of usage. We hope this evaluation will be a resource for readers to better understand effects of drug usage and what traits are heightened after using a certain drug. \n",
