Dataset Idea 1:
Description: Our first dataset idea is different data about MLB season success, including games won, total runs, record, playoffs, etc. We will compare this to the demographic information of the team including age, height, and hometown

Availability: We know there is a website with mlb data baseballreference.com: https://www.baseball-reference.com/?__hstc=213859787.d60590d389b2fa3e895f9fb9013fd874.1727195638490.1727195638490.1727195638490.1&__hssc=213859787.1.1727195638490&__hsfp=1400577961. This was given to us on canvas so we know it is scrapeable and reliable. On the mlb website, there is demographic data for each player including age, height, and hometown: https://www.mlb.com/players. We know this data is reliable and we are pretty sure it is scrapeable as well. 

Questions for Reviewers
We are not sure if the mlb website would be easily scrapeable or if we would have to use an api - we tried to look around online but were not positive if it was?
Should we narrow it to a specific team/region? Should we do individual success or go off the teams and collect the demographic data for the team?


Dataset Idea 2:
Description: Our second dataset idea is to compare suicide rates with population densities of countries around the world. We will see if suicide are lower or higher in countries with higher populations. Is there a proportional relationship we can find between them?

Availability: We know there is this dataset of suicide rates that is scrapable: https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mental-health/suicide-rates (This link is from canvas page, so we know its scrapeable and reliable). For population we found this dataset that has population rate for different countries through the years: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tanishqdublish/world-data-population. This is from kraggle so we know it is scrapeable and it says the license is MIT so it is reliable.


Questions for Reviewers
Should we narrow down our population data to make it specific to the US or is global rates okay? 
Should we do current rates, or compare how the suicide rates have changed overtime with how population rates have changed over time?

Dataset Idea 3:
Description: Our third idea is analyzing drug use and comparing it to demographic information such as age, gender, education level, native country, and personality. This dataset would contain this data for 18 legal and illegal different drugs. 

Availability: We found this dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/373/drug+consumption+quantified which is from a provided link on canvas. It is from uci, which is an educational source, so it is reliable data. This data is easily available to download for free and does require an api. 

Questions for Reviewers
Should we pick a few specific aspects to focus on?
